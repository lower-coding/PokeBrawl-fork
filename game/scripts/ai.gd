extends Node
## Computer-controlled rival. It fills in its fighter's Intent as if it were a gamepad:
## same rules for movement, resources, collisions and timings. It does not read inputs:
## it sees the rival with a delay (what it was doing "reaction" seconds ago), with a
## margin of error and deliberate mistakes depending on the difficulty.
##
## Priorities at every moment:
##   1. defend against concrete threats (incoming projectiles, attacks being prepared
##      nearby, the Earthquake wave: jump as it arrives)
##   2. punish long recoveries and whiffs
##   3. hold the distance that suits its Pokémon and attack with the right move
## It adapts: if the player dodges a lot, it waits out the dodge to punish it.
## With a team (Party) it also looks every so often at whether a teammate would do clearly
## better ("switch_margin", in Party.score's units) and sends it out when the rival is not on
## top of it.
