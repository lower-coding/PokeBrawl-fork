class_name Stats
extends RefCounted
## Turns each species' real base stats (data/species.gd) into battle numbers.
## Everything is computed at level 50 with 31 IVs, no EVs and a neutral nature, so the
## differences between Pokémon are exactly the ones in the games. The formulas are the same
## for everyone: tune them here, never a single Pokémon. Design notes: docs/roster-plan.md.
## What stats do not cover (size, jump, flight, dodge style, passive, moves) stays in
## data/roster.gd. Launch with --hand-stats to play with the old hand-tuned numbers instead.

const LEVEL := 50
## Health = HP at level 50 × this. Battles take about this many times more hits than in the
## games, so they are not over in a few seconds.
const HP_MULT := 6.5
## Held items that change stats, as in the games (roster "item"). The Light Ball doubles
## Pikachu's Attack and Sp. Atk.
const ITEMS := {"lightball": {"atk": 2.0, "spa": 2.0}}


## A stat at level 50 (31 IVs, no EVs, neutral nature), with the games' formula.
