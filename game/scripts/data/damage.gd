class_name Damage
extends RefCounted
## How much a hit takes off, with the games' formula at level 50 so every move does to every
## Pokémon the same share of its health as in the games:
##   (22 × power × Attack / Defense) / 50 + 2
## times STAB (×1.5 if the move is of one of the user's types), type effectiveness (our
## softened table, Roster.affinity) and the average of the games' random roll (×0.925).
## Physical moves use Attack and Defense; special ones, Sp. Atk and Sp. Def, each with its
## stage (Fighter.stages: +1 is x1.5).
## Health is HP × Stats.HP_MULT, so damage is scaled the same way and then divided by
## BATTLE_LENGTH: battles take that many times more hits than in the games (measured on
## the 36 moves with the old hand-tuned damage: 4.2, so they last as long as before).
## A hit that is only part of a use (a stream tick, one of two swipes) deals its share
## (Moves.DATA "split", "power_at"). The weather changes it too (Weather: sun, rain, sand,
## snow; Solar Power).
