class_name Hit
extends RefCounted
## An active hit volume. It is the only thing that deals damage: if its shape does not
## touch the rival's body (a capsule), there is no hit, whatever the effects look like.
##   sphere   center, radius
##   capsule  a, b, radius (a segment with thickness: sweeps, streams)
##   cone     origin, dir, length, angle (Flamethrower)
##   ring     center, r_in, r_out, only hits whoever touches the ground (Earthquake: jump it)
## With "local", positions are in the user's space (x right, y up, z forward) and
## follow its body; otherwise they are in world space.
